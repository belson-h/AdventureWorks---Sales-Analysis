# AdventureWorks---Sales-Analysis

## Project description
This sales analysis is a school project and uses data from the AdventureWorks2025 database, accessed through SQL Server. Python is employed to retrieve the data and generate visualizations that support a clear and insightful analysis. While the majority of data processing and transformation is performed in SQL, additional transformations are applied in Python when needed to enhance the visualizations.

## Project structure

The analysis, presented in Jupyter Notebook, addresses a series of predefined business questions, alongside one in-depth, supplementary investigation designed to provide deeper insights into AdevntureWorks' product portfolio.

### Predefined business question

1. Products per category
2. Revenue per category
3. Monthly Revenue Overtime
4. Total sales and total orders per year
5. Top 10 products
6. Total sales and customer per region
7. AOV per region and customer type

### Product portfolio analysis 

AdventureWorks’ product portfolio is analysed to evaluate product performance and identify opportunities for strategic improvement. The analysis focuses on sales volume, revenue, and profitability in order to distinguish high-performing products from underperforming ones.
