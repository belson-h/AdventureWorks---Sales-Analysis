# AdventureWorks---Sales-Analysis

## Project description
This sales analysis is a school project and uses data from the AdventureWorks2025 database, accessed through SQL Server. Python is employed to retrieve the data and generate visualizations that support a clear and insightful analysis. While the majority of data processing and transformation is performed in SQL, additional transformations are applied in Python when needed to enhance the visualizations.

The analysis, presented in Jupyter Notebook, addresses a series of predefined business questions, alongside one in-depth, supplementary investigation designed to provide deeper insights.
